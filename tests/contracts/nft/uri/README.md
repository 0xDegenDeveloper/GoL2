## This directory is for testing the URI generation of the NFT contract

- _`example.json`_

  - This is an example of what the JSON object looks like once the result of token_uri() is resolved by the browser.

- _`example.svg`_

  - This is an example of what the SVG object looks like once double resolved by the browser (resolved once to the JSON object, and then again when pasting the "image" field into the browser).

- _`nft_uri_and_svg.py`_

  - This script outputs the JSON URI for the acorn's evolution (generation #2).

See _[here](../../../../src/README.md#on-chain-token-uris)_ for instructions.
