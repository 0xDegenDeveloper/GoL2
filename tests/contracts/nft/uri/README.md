## This directory is for testing the URI generation of the NFT contract

- `example.json`

  - This is an example of what the JSON object looks like once the result of token_uri() is resolved by the browser.

- `nft_uri_and_svg.py`

  - This script outputs the JSON URI for the acorn's evolution (generation #2).

See [here](../../../README.md#running-urisvg-tests) for instructions.
